% roi_getact() - compute activity of a given ROI (region of interest)
%
% Usage:
%    [power, powernorm] = roi_getact(roi_data, ind_roi);
%    [power, powernorm] = roi_getact(roi_data, ind_roi, nPCA, zscore);
%
% Inputs:
%    roi_data - [times x voxels x trials] source activity data
%    ind_roi  - indices of voxels for the ROI
%    nPCA     - number of PCA components (default is 1).
%    zscore   - [0|1] z-score data (default is 0 or false).
